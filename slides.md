# Rust Learning Sessions

## Introduction

Welcome to Rust Learning Sessions! This is a hands-on tutorial where we'll explore Rust programming concepts through practical exercises.

### About This Session

I'm still learning Rust myself, so expect some mistakes or me fumbling to explain some concepts. This is a collaborative learning experience!

---

## What We'll Cover

### 1. Basic Concepts
- Variables and data types
- Ownership and borrowing
- Memory safety without garbage collection

### 2. Practical Exercises
- Function implementation
- Error handling
- Working with collections

### 3. Advanced Topics
- Structs and enums
- Pattern matching
- Traits and generics

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic programming knowledge
- Rust installed on your system
- A text editor or IDE

### Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `cargo test` to see available exercises

---

## Exercise Structure

Each exercise follows this pattern:
- **Problem**: Clear description of what to implement
- **Tests**: Comprehensive test cases
- **Solution**: Reference implementation (after attempting)

### Running Exercises
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific exercise
cargo test exercise_01

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

---

## Learning Path

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic function implementation
2. **Build Confidence**: Work through progressively complex exercises
3. **Practice Regularly**: Rust concepts take time to internalize
4. **Don't Give Up**: The borrow checker is your friend!
